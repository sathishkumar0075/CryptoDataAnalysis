
ðŸ“ˆ Live Cryptocurrency Dashboard
================================

Overview
--------

This project provides a real-time cryptocurrency dashboard, fetching live data from the CoinGecko API for the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The dashboard displays live prices, market data, and insightful analysis of the top 5 cryptocurrencies, average price, highest and lowest price change over the last 24 hours. The dashboard refreshes periodically, and the data can be exported to an Excel file for further analysis.
